# AssetCache Plugin

AssetCache plugin allows you to download a file from the world wide web and download it to the local web folder of your app. 

Then, you will be able to access it from web source or delete it aswell.

## How to use

* import the plugin to your project as explained [here](https://github.com/cobaltians/cobalt/wiki/Plugins-usage)
* Add the cobalt.asset-cache.js to your web JS folder
* Add an html link to the cobalt.assetcache.js plugin script after the cobalt link in the HEAD tag

## download

Use the `cobalt.assetCache.download` method like this

    cobalt.assetCache.download({
        url : 'https://server.com/path/file.ext'
      },
      function(data){
        cobalt.log('status', data.status, data);
    });

Parameters :

* First parameter is an object, that must contain :
  - `url` : (string) The url of the file to download from a server on the web
* `callback` : (function) The callback that will receive download status (see below).


### callback

Native side is sending download progress events using the web callback. Here is the data that can be sent in this callback :

**Download progress**

`{ status: 'downloading', progress : 42 }`

File is downloading. Download progress is at 42%.

**Download success and file available**

`{ status: 'success', path: '/.../a_random_file_name' }`

File has been successfully downloaded and is available at the given `path` for web use.

**Errors**

`{ status: 'error', cause : 'permissionDenied' }`

`{ status: 'error', cause : 'networkError' }`

## delete

Use the `cobalt.assetCache.delete` method like this

    cobalt.assetCache.delete({ 
        url: 'https://server.com/path/file.ext'
        //or
        path: '/.../previously_received_random_file_name'
      },
      function(data){
        cobalt.log('status', data.status, data);
    });

Here, in the first parameter, web can send `path` or `url`.

* `path` : (string) the local path of the file that was received in a download success callback.
* `url` : (string) the url of the file that was used in the download method.
